# Favourite Food Poll
A decentralized voting app where you can vote to see the most liked food. 

## How it was built
To build a dApp you need a smart contract, which runs on a blockchain. Using [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) I wrote the smart contract and deployed it to the rinkeby test network. The front-end was done using jquery, javascript, html and css. 

## How to use it
1. Download the [metamask](https://metamask.io/) chrome extension.
2. Create an account and switch it to the rinkeby test network
3. Get fake ethers from a [faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/), you need this to use the application as making a transaction like voting requires using [gas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)

## What's next?
- Currently, the dapp gives you a new vote every time you enter the website, giving you essentially an infinite number of votes. Next step is to prevent this
- The UI can be improved. For example, a better colour scheme, making sure the images don't stretch, just generally improving the UI
- Making the website mobile friendly
